<h1>Assignment One: Dear Data Redux</h1>
<i>Due September 18, 2020 by 11:59pm via GitHub Classroom</i>

Data reflects the world around us. We generate data through each action we take and each decision we make. However, most of this data is simply passes by and is never collected or used. In this first module, we explore patterns in data about our daily lives and use different media to explore and make sense of this data. 

Building on the activities conducted by Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, you will collect data in the course of your daily activities and visualize that data to surface hidden patterns in your life. You will then synthesize your own reflections on these patterns and the process of constructing the visualizations as part of a write-up. 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
You will work through three data collection activities and visualize the results of these activities using different media (e.g., sketching, web tools, clay, legos, etc). You will then reflect on the data and methods used to generate each visualization and synthesize your findings in a series of written activities. The assignment is worth a total of 50 points.

<h3>Data Collection (9 points total): </h3>
You will choose 3 specific questions that can be answered using data from your day-to-day life. To answer each question, you will actively collect data over the course of at least three days (though you may use a longer timespan if you wish or if the question necessitates). I would encourage you to use datasets that allow you to collect data throughout the day to give yourself more interesting information to work with; however, you may supplement the data with data from other sources. For example, if you’re monitoring how you spend your time online and currently use a productivity tracker, you may use historic data to supplement the collected data. Some questions for inspiration are available from Dear Data at http://www.dear-data.com/by-week/#/week-49-a-week-of-data/.  
<br/><br/>

While I will not ask you to share your datasets, I do ask that keep track of how you collect your data. In your write-up, you will note the specific question you asked, the data you collected to address that question, and describe the process used to collect that data, including the frequency you collected the data with and any external tools that helped you track your data. 

<h3>Visualization (36 points total): </h3>
For each dataset you collect, you will create a visualization of that data. Each visualization should use a different technique (e.g., line graphs, pie charts, etc) and a different medium (e.g., Tableau, Illustrator, sketching, legos, food, etc). Visualizations will be graded on their creativity and on how well they reveal patterns in the data.
<br/><br/>
For each visualization, your write-up should describe the process you used to create the visualization in detail, including a justification and explanation of the visualization design as relates to the data and a description of your choice of media. Your write-up should also include a discussion of what the data tell you about your target question. 
<br/><br/>

While we conventionally turn to tools like Excel or Tableau as a means of visualizing data, automated tools can also remove us from creative and reflective opportunities afforded by the process of composing a visualization. Please do not use automated charting tools such as Tableau, PowerBI, or Excel for more than one of your three visualizations (you may skip these tools entirely if you’d like). If you use an automated tool, please do explore the capabilities of the tool beyond the default settings and describe your process in detail in your write-up. 


<h3>Synthesis (5 points total): </h3>
After addressing the three target questions, take a moment to reflect on how your process of working with the data in each medium shaped your understanding of the data. Your write-up should contain a synthesis that compares and contrasts your experiences with creating the three visualizations. Did any media make patterns particularly easy or difficult to assess? Do you feel any of the three visualizations are particularly engaging or effective? How did your process of answering your target question shift across media? Please include any other observations you find particularly relevant for understanding your processes and resulting visualizations. 

<h2>Submission Materials: </h2>
Please submit a PDF document containing the following: 

* For each visualization (15 points each)
  * The question the data reflects (1 pt) 
  * A brief summary of how you collected the data (2 pts)
  * At least one image of your visualization (6 pts)
  * A description of the process used in each visualization (3 pts)
  * A synthesis of what the data tells you about your target question (3 pts)
* A written synthesis of the activity (5 points)

You may also include any additional materials (e.g., interactive visualizations, short video clips, etc) that will help illustrate your visualizations. I recommend explicitly labeling the various sections and subsections of your write-up to make it clear what elements map to which questions and to which requirements. There is no page length or formatting requirement, but I ask you use a professional format (no wingdings, please!) and provide enough detail to make your responses and conclusions clear. 

## Bells & Whistles (aka Extra Credit):
1. *Build your Portfolio (3 pts):* The work you do in this course and others is intended to help you build an array of skills for your professional career. You can showcase these skills through a professional portfolio hosted in on a public platform such as your personal website (e.g., [Mary West’s](https://www.ettawest.com/projects)) or Medium (e.g., Giorgia Lupi’s discussion of her [Bruises](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/bruises-the-data-we-dont-see-1fdec00d0036) piece). Translate your submission into a web-compatible, publicly accessible portfolio entry and link that entry in the bottom of your submission document. 1 point per visualization. 

2. *Digging Deeper (5 pts):*  Choose one of your three questions to visualize in a second way. The medium used to visualize the dataset should differ from the three main visualizations. Include an image of this visualization next to the original visualization in your write-up and describe the process used to create it as well as the differences in your understanding of the data generated using this second process. 

3. *A Common Thread (3 pts):*  Answering one question often raises several more. While you can complete the data collection activities over any timeframe you’d like, asking the questions in sequence allows you to more deeply probe a central driving question. You can elect to address a single, common theme with your three questions, allowing them to build on one another by collecting the data sequentially. In your write-up, note what that theme is at the start of your write-up and include an explicitly-labeled subsection in your synthesis that discusses how the sequence of questions both informs the central theme and how the questions build on one another (i.e., how did Q1 inform Q2, etc.).
